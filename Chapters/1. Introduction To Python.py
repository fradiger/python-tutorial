1. INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON


IDENTIFIERS

    - Identifiers are names given to entities like variable, functions, classes etc.

    - Python is case-sensitive.

    - Python is a dynamically-typed and weakly or duck-typed language

        - In dynamically-typed languages, it is possible to bind a name to objects of different types during the execution of the program.

        - A weakly-typed language has looser typing rules.

    - Rules to define an Identifier.

        - Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_). Ex. jackieChan, super_man_123, 

        - An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1Love is not a valid identifier.

        - The Keywords or Reserved Word below cannot be used as identifiers.

            - and, as, assert, async, await, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, exec, False, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, None, nonlocal, not, or, pass, print, raise, return, True, try, while, with, yield

    Things to Rememeber: 

    - When defining an Identifier, do you fellow programmers a favour and use descriptive names. Don't use c where you can write count and don't use a where you can write num1. 

    - Use either camel-casing or underscore seperation.

    - identifiers, keywords, literals, operators, and delimiters

LINES AND INDENTATION

    - Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks.

    - 

multi-line statements
