Listing Files in a Directory

    >>> import os
    >>> print(os.listdir("C:/Users/Quark/Documents/shuffler"))  

https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html

Testing File Types

    - We can use endswith to test this out.

Removing Files and Directories

    - os.remove() or os.unlink()

    - os.rmdir(): Removes the specified directory. The directory must be empty or Python will display an exception message.

    - shutil.rmtree(): Removes the specified directory, all subdirectories, and all files. This function is especially dangerous because it removes everything without checking (Python assumes that you know what youâ€™re doing). As a result, you can easily lose data using this function.
